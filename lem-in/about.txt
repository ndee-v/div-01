This project is meant to make you code a digital version of an ant farm.
Upon successfully finding the quickest path, lem-in will display the content
of the file passed as argument and each move the ants make from room to room.


This program code was written by Andrey Vishnyakov (ndee-v),
who was at that time a student of the first stream of Alem school.
